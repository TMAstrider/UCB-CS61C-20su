Exercise #1


1.What do the .data, .word, .text directives mean (i.e. what do you use them for)? Hint: think about the 4 sections of memory.

.data is a read-write section containing global or static variables
.word is essentially creating some space in memory to hold data. Each item following it is 4 bytes long. It's similar to creating an array:
.text is the code section tho


2.Run the program to completion. What number did the program output? What does this number represent?

the program output 34.
And that represents the 9th fibonacci sequence number.


3.At what address is n stored in memory? Hint: Look at the contents of the registers.

At what address is n stored in memory? Hint: Look at the contents of the registers.


4.Without actually editing the code (i.e. without going into the “Editor” tab), have the program calculate the 13th fib number (0-indexed) by manually modifying the value of a register. You may find it helpful to first step through the code. If you prefer to look at decimal values, change the “Display Settings” option at the bottom.

Mannuly change the value(plus 4 specificly) stored in register x28
