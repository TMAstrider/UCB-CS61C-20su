Exercise 1:

1.32 bytes
2.3, 7, 0, 7
3.No, No, 

checkoff questions:
1.At the very first access, the virtual address was dvided into 2 parts, the first 3-bit as page #, and the last 5-bit as offset. Then the VPN is looked up in TLB. And since None of VPN was matched with page number in TLB, leading a TLB miss.
    then it goes down to page table. the valid bit of that page is 0, which leads to a page fault. and so it literaly goes down to hard disk and fetch data from it and write to physical memory. and the TLB is updated at the same time.

2. because the hard disk is much bigger than physical memory, and got paged a lot.

Exercise 2:
1.The memory access: 00 20 40 60 80 a0 c0 e0 00 20.
you will got 10 miss as long as you don't access four identical address repeatly,

Exercise 3:
1. Increasing the size of pyhsical memory

Exercise 4:
1.P1, P2, P3, P4 are 4 different process that accessing pysical memory.
explaination: cuz every time the process alters, the tlb is somehow cleared, and that the reason for a much higher percentage of TLB misses in this simulation
